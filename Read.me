My name is Garrett Tinlin and I created a website for an online tutoring service. 
On the Home page it will give you an overview of what we offer. 
There is a bootstrap carousel attached to this page as you will see the photo change after 3.5 seconds of showing. 
If you are interested in joining our services and want to know what subjects we offer. 
Then click the "Subject" link in the nav bar. 
This page will have a table that tells you what subjects are offered to each grade and when we are available to tutor. 
If you need our help then just click on the "Sign-Up" link in the nav bar. 
This page has a form that you will fill out telling us all about yourself and when you are available. 
At the end of the form hit the "submit" button. 
I used 3 .html pages and a .css that styled all of the html pages. 
I decided to include a JS file to get the carousel function to work and along with attaching images to the pages. 
I think it adds a lot to the page and gives you an idea of what you are getting from us. 
One thing I want to improve is the Nav Bar at the top. 
It is too simple and as I grow the website I will add to this Bar and make it more functional. 
A second thing I want ot work on is making the table on the "Subject" page to be more descriptive. 
The information in the table is very vague and I want to add mroe information for what we are offereing. 
The last thing I want to add is more Javascript. 
The whole site is not very interactive and once I learn more about JS, I will make the Submit button on the "Sign-Up" page linked to another part so that I can get your information to start helping the student. 
There are more things I would like to work on but this is just the beginning.
